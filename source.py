# # The problem of unemployed college graduatesüìù
# 
# ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg)

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù Unemployment regarding college graduates

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# 
# üìù Are unemployment rates for college graduates rising or falling over time, and how do these rates compare to overall unemployment rates across different countries?

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# 
# üìù I hypothesize that college graduates‚Äô unemployment varies tremendously from country to country depending on economic stability, labour market needs, and education. Economy and job markets in economies with strong employment such as Germany or Canada should be lower when compared with economies with weak economy or youth unemployment, such as Greece or Spain. In the US i think that college graduates‚Äô unemployment rate is slightly lower than the overall unemployment rate but has been a bit more volatile due to economic downturns (global financial crisis of 2008, COVID-19, etc.) These spikes may be short-lived, but the longer-term picture could be a gradual drop in graduates‚Äô unemployment as economies recover and meet new market demands, especially in skilled areas.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù
# - URL(FILE): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pantanjali/unemployment-dataset
# - URL(FILE): https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CGBD2024
# - URL(API): https://www.bls.gov/developers/home.htm
# 
# In order to properly represent the issue of college graduates who don‚Äôt have jobs, the following variables from these datasets can be mapped:
# 
# **Unemployment Dataset**: This dataset has unemployment statistics for different demographic groups, such as education. Several variables of interest in integrating could be:
# - Year
# - State or Region
# - Degree Levels (e.g., Bachelor Degree)
# 
# **Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)**: This dataset tracks economic indicators like the labor market. The relevant variables to merge could be:
# - Year
# - State or Region
# - Rate Of Labour Force %
# 
# **BLS API**: The BLS API gives a wide range of labor market statistics, such as:
# - Year
# - Industry
# - Geographic Region (State, MSA)

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# 
# üìùI will use descriptive data to describe unemployment rates of college graduates,do trend analysis to look for trends across the years, between countries with more and less unemployment and Use visualizations like line graphs and bar graphs to show trends and country comparisons

# ## Importing libraries and loading datasets

# In[3]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# ## Data cleaning
# ### Cleaned data by:
# - Handled missing or NaN values.
# - Renamed columns for clarity.
# - Converted 'Year' to datetime format.
# - Extracted year from 'Date' and create a new 'Year' column.
# - Dropped columns that may not be necessary.
# - Melted the DataFrame to have a long format for better analysis.
# - Observing if any data points doesnt fit the rest of the data: outliers

# ## Line chart for unemployment_analysis with plotly
# **Description: This interactive line chart, built with Plotly, shows unemployment rates for different countries over selected years (e.g., 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020). It uses a dropdown or legend to allow users to toggle countries on/off, providing interactivity.**
# 
# Insights: The interactive feature enhances comparison across countries. You can easily spot which countries faced higher unemployment rates during certain years and identify global or regional trends. For example, global recessions like the 2008 financial crisis may be reflected in multiple countries.

# **Insights: This table is useful to spot any potential errors or convergence of BLS/FRED unemployment data. It‚Äôs handy for confirming that unemployment data are the same from different sources. And if both the datasets are similar it makes you feel better about the trend‚Äôs validity. If they don‚Äôt match, then that may be something to probe into reporting and/or data collection gaps.**

# ## Machine learning
# For this project I could try various machine learning methods like supervised learning methods. I might use regression to predict unemployment, for example, on the basis of some critieria such as economic metrics or demographic information. Classification Algorithms could also be applicable if I am looking to sort data according to regions of high, medium, or low unemployment.
# 
# But there are a couple of problems here. One is the quality and completeness of the data. Data that‚Äôs missing or not reflected can bias or make your model fail. Also, if the dataset is disproportionately large (e.g., more data points are in some years/locations) this can affect classification accuracy.
# 
# Features and engineering are a second possibility. It is very important for performance to decide which features to map on to the model and how to model them. And there are also sometimes complex relationships in the data that need more complex models or preprocessing.
